                  What Kind of Cognitive Distortion Is This?
                </dt>
                <dd class="mt-2 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">Cognitive distortions are biased or irrational ways of thinking that contribute to emotional distress. By identifying the type of distortion, individuals can better understand how they might be misinterpreting situations. Common distortions include "all-or-nothing thinking," "catastrophizing," and "overgeneralization." Using the previous example, thinking "I'm terrible at my job" after a minor mistake could be an "overgeneralization." </dd>

By looking at situations rationally and gathering contrary evidence, individuals can counteract their distorted beliefs. For the aforementioned example, evidence against the thought might include: "I've received positive feedback in the past," or "Everyone makes mistakes sometimes."</dd>
